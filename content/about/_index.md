yamabiko (山彦) is a mountain god, spirit, and yōkai in Japanese folklore. Often they are heard, but never seen.

Literally translated to "echo", the term is also used to describe the phenomenon of a delayed echo in mountains and valleys, and is thought to be the spirit answering.

This anomaly is also sometimes called "kodama", when it is thought to be the answering voice of a tree spirit.
